        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Egusi soup is native to West Africa, and many of my American and Nigerian friends enjoy this recipe when I make it.</p>
            <p>Ground egusi seeds give the soup a unique flavor. </p>
            It's a delicious and hearty soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while.</pre>
